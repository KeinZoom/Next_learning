### Dynamic Rendering
- a server rendering strategy where routes are **rendered for each user at request time**
- useful when a route has data that is personalized to the user or contains information that can only be **known at request time**, such as cookies or the URL's search parameters

### How to Dynamically Render
- If a `dynamic function` is discovered, Next.js will switch to dynamically rendering the whole route
- dynamic functions: `cookies()`, `headers()` and `searchParams`
- Next.js will **automatically** choose the best rendering strategy for each route based on the **features and APIs used**

### Steaming_rendering
- a strategy that allows for **progressive** UI rendering from the server
- Work is divided into **chunks** and **streamed** to the client as soon as it's ready
- Streaming significantly improves both the **initial page loading** performance and the **rendering** of UI elements that **rely on slower data fetches**, which would otherwise block the rendering of the entire route
- streaming is **integrated** into the Next.js App Router by default

```typescript
import { Review } from "@/components/review";
import { Sales } from "@/components/sales";
import { Suspense } from "react";

export default function ProductDetail() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>this is product detail page</h1>
      <Suspense fallback={<p>loading data, please wait</p>}>
        <Review />
      </Suspense>
      <Suspense fallback={<p>loading data, please wait</p>}>
        <Sales />
      </Suspense>
    </div>
  );
}
```

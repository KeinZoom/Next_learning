### Static rendering
- a server rendering strategy where we generate HTML pages at the time of building app
- allow the page to be built once, **cached by a CDN**, and serverd to the client almost **instantly**
- particularly useful for blog pages, e-commerce product pages, documentation, and marketing pages

### How to statically render
- **default rendering strategy** in the app router
- for production builds, a page will be pre-rendered once when we run the build command


#### Prefetching
- a technique used to **preload** a route in the **background** before the user navigates to it
- Route are automatically prefetched as they become **visible** in the user's **viewport**, either when the page first loads or as it comes into view through scrolling
- for **static** routes, the **entire route** is prefetched and cached by default for fast navigation

### Static Rendering Summary
- Along with the HTML, **RSC payload** is created for each component, and JS chunks are produced for client-side component hydration in the browser
- if navigate **directly** to a page route, the **corresponding HTML file** is served
- if navigate to the route **from a different one**, the route is **created** on the client side using the **RSC payload and JS chunks**, without any additional requests to the server

### Revalidation
- Revalidation is the process of purging the Data Cache and re-fetching the latest data
#### Time-based revalidation
Next.js automatically revalidates data after a certain amount of time has passed
`await fetch("url", {next: {revalidate: 10}})`<br>
`export const revalidate = 10`

- Regarding the revalidation frequency, **the lowest revalidate time** across each layout and page of a single route will determine the revalidation frequency of the entire route, the frequency of parent segment affects the childs' revalidate time.

### Server-only Code
- Certain code is intended to **execute only on the server**
- It is crucial to separate server-only code from client-side code to protect the application's security and integrity, avoid code that's meant only for the server to **unintentionally end up in the client**

#### Server-only package
- Provide **a build-time error** if developers accidentally import one of these server-only modules into a Client Component
- `npm i server-only`

```typescript
// server only modules
import "server-only";

export function ServerOnlyFunc() {
  const data = "server only data";
  return data;
}
```

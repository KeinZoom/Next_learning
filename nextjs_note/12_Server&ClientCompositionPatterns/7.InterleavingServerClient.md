### Interleaving Server and Client Components
- supported that SC under SC, CC under CC and CC under SC, while SC under CC is not supported, because CC is rendered and generated after SC
- use SC as a `prop: children` to interleave with CC, `prop` will accept both elements. It provides a placeholder first.
